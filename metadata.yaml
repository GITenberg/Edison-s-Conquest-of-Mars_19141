description: "Edison's Conquest of Mars is an 1898 science fiction novel by American\
  \ astronomer and writer Garrett P. Serviss. It was written as a sequel to Fighters\
  \ from Mars, an unauthorized and heavily altered version of H. G. Wells's The War\
  \ of the Worlds. It has a place in the history of science fiction for its early\
  \ employment of themes and motifs that later became staples of the genre.\nThe book\
  \ features Thomas Edison as the primary character, though neither Edison nor H.\
  \ G. Wells were involved in its creation. Set after the devastating Martian attack\
  \ in the previous story, the novel depicts Edison leading a group of scientists\
  \ to develop ships and weapons, including a disintegration ray, for the defence\
  \ of Earth. Edison and company fight the aliens in space and on Mars, eventually\
  \ causing a flood that defeats the enemy and forces an end to hostilities. Serviss\
  \ wrote himself into the story as a professor whom Edison consults; also appearing\
  \ are scientists such as Edward Emerson Barnard, Lord Kelvin, Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen, and\
  \ Silvanus P. Thompson, and heads of state such as Queen Victoria, U.S. President\
  \ William McKinley, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Emperor Mutsuhito.\nServiss' first attempt\
  \ at fiction, the book was published serially in the New York Journal. Serviss went\
  \ on to write other science fiction stories, arguably making him the first American\
  \ to write science fiction professionally. An early example of what would later\
  \ be called space opera, Edison's Conquest of Mars was also a particularly literal\
  \ \"Edisonade\". The book contains some notable \"firsts\" in science fiction: alien\
  \ abductions, spacesuits (called \"air-tight suits\": see Spacesuits in fiction),\
  \ aliens building the Pyramids, space battles, oxygen pills, asteroid mining and\
  \ disintegrator rays.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
